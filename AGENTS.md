# Collaboration Rules

## Required Workflow (User Approval First)
For this repository, the assistant must follow this process on every task:

1. Restate understanding of the user's request.
2. Provide a concrete step-by-step plan.
3. Wait for explicit user approval.
4. Only after approval, run commands, edit files, commit, or push.

Without explicit user approval, no execution actions are allowed.
